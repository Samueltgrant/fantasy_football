# fantasy football
In a doomed attempt to reduce my constant suffering at fantasy football, I have tried to use a quantitative approach to selecting players for my fantasy team.

The results of my initial analysis can be seen in player_analysis.ipynb (jupyter notebook). I have been playing about with the idea of creating a computer generated team for next season to compete against my friends. My untidied workings to this can be found in xxx but this will need some more thought before next season.
