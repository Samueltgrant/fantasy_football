# fantasy football
In a doomed attempt to reduce my constant suffering at fantasy football, I have tried to use a quantitative approach to selecting players for my fantasy team.

The results of my initial analysis can be seen in player_analysis.ipynb (jupyter notebook). I have been playing about with the idea of creating a computer generated team for next season to compete against my friends. My untidied workings to this can be found in select_best_team.ipnb but this will need some more thought before next season.
